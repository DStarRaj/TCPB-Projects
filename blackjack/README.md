# Blackjack

[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) (_formerly **black jack** and **vingt-un**_) is a casino banking game. Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.

In this project I have made the representation of a Blackjack Game played between user and the Dealer (computer).

## Game Logic

* The Game Logic is universal and thus the same is implemented here.
* The only difference is that, only "Hit" and "Stand" logics are implemented for the sake of simplicity.

## Implementation
It's a CLI based game and can be run with python installed on system with no other libraries needed. The game starts with 100 chips in players account, and player can choose how much to bet, then the standard blackjack starts

### Running the Game
```bash
python bj.py
```

### Inputs to the Game
To enhance the game experience, the program requests the name of the players as input. Also, it requires bet amount and the choice between Hit or Stand as inputs too.
